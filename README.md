# Web-Scraping
I wanted to create a dataset showing winners of the Tokyo Marathon and convert it into a csv file. I figured Wikipedia might be the most convenient source of data for the marathon.
# Tools used
I made use of Python and my IDE of choice was Jupyter Notebook. I used the following libraries in Python:
1. Pandas
2. BeautifulSoup
3. Requests
